# BARE

A tool to manage all your boilerplate from cli and generate files for you !
![Bare Demo](https://github.com/bare-cli/bare/blob/main/assets/bare-demo.gif)

## Trivia

Bare was created by @madrix01 to manage boilerplate that is created by us for every new project.
He called templates as bare-bones and hence the tool `bare`.

bare-li tries to build upon the existing features of bare, try to simplify the interface and also
add support for more templates.
